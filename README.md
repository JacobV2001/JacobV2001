## ðŸ“š Projects
Here are some of my projects showcasing my work in **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**:
- [Endgame Image Classifier](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Avengers-EndGame-Image-Classification) - A machine learning project that classifies images of people based on facial features and compares them to characters from *Avengers: Endgame*. The model uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) and facial feature extraction techniques to determine which character an individual resembles the most.
